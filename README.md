Hello Hello!

Welcome to my NoSQL Challenge, this should be fairly straight forward here, you will find the setup and the starter files in the main folder. The json file with the establishments is in the resources folder.

All code was written by me using class resources and troubleshooting with our class AI tool.
Please let me know if you have any questions or run into any issues. 

Thank you!
