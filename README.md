# nosql-challenge

Hello Hello!

This project displays my knowledge of NoSql Databases specifically Mongo Databases. In this scenario I am running analysis for magazine editors of Eat Safe, Love, to help their journalists have a data driven list of areas to focus on in their future articles.

All data was provided to me via the UCI Data Analytics course in the form of a JSON file, I used mongo client to house the database, clean it, add to it, and from query it. 

How the data works: 
Hygiene Scores: The higher the score, the worst the condition
Rating Values: The higher the score, the best conditions overall categories

Once it was set up, analysis was run to isolate the restaurants with cleanliness ratings of 20 or lower, then further isolation of resturaunts with rating values of 4 or higher. More analysis was ran on restaurants with a cleanliness rating of 5 or lower, closest to the newest restaurant added to the database, Penang Flavours. 
Final analysis concludes a list of restaurants with hygeine ratings of 0 organized by Local Authority!
